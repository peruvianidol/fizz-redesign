<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Design Tokens</h2>
<p>The system should use design tokens as its single source of truth, enabling us to quickly make large scale visual changes that propagate across platforms with minimal engineering effort.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Encourage Collaboration &amp; Ownership</h2>
<p>The more people who contribute to the system, the broader the institutional knowledge becomes and the less it feels like arbitrary rules constraining creativity.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Accessibility &amp; Performance</h2>
<p>The system should keep accessibility and performance top of mind in creating new UI components, adhering to standards and not compromising for the sake of aesthetics.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Tech-Agnostic</h2>
<p>The system should not be tied to a specific design tool or tech stack, as these things change frequently.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Define Building Blocks, Not Features</h2>
<p>The system should provide the building blocks for designers and engineers to innovate on new features and not exceed its scope into features.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Avoid Context-Specific Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>The system should build features from atomic-level components and layout helpers to avoid the need for feature-specific styles.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Visual Style/UI Components</h2>
<p>The system should clearly distinguish between UI components and their visual styles (color, type, spacing, etc.).</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Align Design Tools &amp; Frameworks</h2>
<p>The system should ensure that our design tools reflect what is available in our engineering frameworks, which requires close, frequent collaboration between design and engineering.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Think Proportionately</h2>
<p>The systemâ€™s UI components should let content, padding and border dictate their dimensions and arrange them using relative units rather than fixed pixel values to support a broad range of devices.</p>

<h2 class="fizz-heading-3 fizz-stack-4">Cross-Platform</h2>
<p>The system should support web, Android and iOS, and reduce the amount of one-off designs that cater to specific platforms.</p>
